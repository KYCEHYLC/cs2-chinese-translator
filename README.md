# cs2-chinese-translator
This is a simple python script that will translate your text into chinese and copy it into your clipboard with adding "say_team" to it, so you just need to paste the text in console and press Enter. Now you can speak to your chinese teammates if you don't know chinese.

All you need is to find the ISO-639-1 code of the language you are translating your text from, the list of codes can be found [here](https://localizely.com/iso-639-1-list/).
